# CHTC Python Project Template

This project provides a basic guide to running a Python project through UW's Center for High-Throughput Computing.

This guide will show you how to:
1. Configure your project's packages through a **build** file
2. Set up your primary Python scripts, shell scripts, and a **submit** file
3. Split your project up into discrete **jobs**
4. Run your project through CHTC

## Configuring the Project's Build

In order to run any program through CHTC, you need to install the [software](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/software-overview-htc) that your program needs.
